# Scraping Yelp
Do you want to find the best restaurants in Copenhagen and what characterizes them?

This repository contains and R code that can be used to scrape information about Copenhagen restaurants from Yelp. The information scraped is everything from price level, location, facilities, whether you can smoke or not and much more. 

I have included code to visualize interesting parts of the data (such as price level vs. ratings). I have also geolocated the restaurant addresses ussing ggmap, calculated their distance from the city center and plotted them on a map of Copenhagen.
